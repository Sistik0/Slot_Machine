# Slot machine program replicates the functionality of real world slot machines.

# The user first inputs the money they'd like to deposit into the slot machine.

# The program allows the user to back out of the machine before asking them how many lines they'd

# like to play and how much they'd like to bet on each line.

# The total bet is displayed followed by the outcome of the spin.

# Winnings are added on to the user's balance and the slot machine automatically ends when the

# balance reaches 0.
